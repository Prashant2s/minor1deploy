Slide 2: The Problem - Why We Built This?

  - Universities receive thousands of certificate verification requests
  - Manual verification is slow and error-prone
  - Takes days or weeks to verify a single certificate
  - Risk of fake certificates and forged documents
  - No centralized system for instant verification

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Slide 3: Our Solution - What We Created

  - AI-powered system that reads and extracts data from certificates automatically
  - Uses OpenAI GPT-4 to understand certificate content
  - Verifies information against university database instantly
  - Works with photos and PDFs of certificates
  - Gives results in 10-30 seconds instead of days

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Slide 4: How It Works - The Magic Behind It

Step 1: Student/Employer uploads certificate image or PDF

Step 2: Our AI reads the certificate like a human would
  - Extracts student name, enrollment number, grades, CGPA
  - Identifies subjects, credits, and degree information

Step 3: System compares data with university database

Step 4: Shows verification result with confidence score

2. Different Certificate Formats
  - Challenge: Each university has different layouts
  - Solution: AI learns patterns from various formats

3. Handwritten vs Printed Text
  - Challenge: Some certificates have handwritten portions
  - Solution: Combined multiple OCR engines for accuracy

4. API Costs
  - Challenge: OpenAI API charges per request
  - Solution: Optimized prompts to reduce token usage

5. Processing Time
  - Challenge: Large PDFs took too long
  - Solution: Optimized image compression and processing

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Slide 12: Limitations & Disadvantages - What We Need to Improve

Current Limitations:

Requires Internet
  - Needs OpenAI API connection
  - Cannot work offline

API Costs
  - Each verification costs money (OpenAI charges)
  - Can be expensive for bulk processing

Not 100% Accurate
  - AI confidence varies (usually 85-95%)
  - Very poor quality images may fail

Limited to Certificates in Database
  - Only verifies if university has uploaded records
  - New graduates may not be in system yet

Privacy Concerns
  - Certificate data sent to OpenAI servers
  - Need strong security measures

Depends on OpenAI Service
  - If OpenAI is down, system won't work
  - Need backup OCR solution

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Slide 13: Security & Privacy - Keeping Data Safe

Security Measures:

Data Protection
  - All uploads encrypted during transfer
  - Secure database storage
  - No data shared with third parties

Access Control
  - University admin controls database

Presentation Tips:

Design Guidelines:
  1. Use consistent colors - Stick to 2-3 main colors (university colors preferred)
  2. Limit text - Maximum 5-6 bullet points per slide
  3. Use visuals - Add icons, screenshots, diagrams
  4. Readable fonts - Minimum 24pt font size
  5. White space - Don't overcrowd slides

For Each Slide:
  - 1 main idea per slide
  - Use simple language (avoid technical jargon)
  - Add relevant images/icons
  - Practice speaking points (don't read directly from slides)

Demo Preparation:
  - Have backup screenshots ready
  - Test internet connection
  - Prepare sample certificates to upload
  - Show both success and error cases

Q&A Preparation:
Expected Questions:
  1. How accurate is the AI? → 85-95% depending on image quality
  2. What if certificate is in different language? → Currently English only, expanding later
  3. How much does it cost to run? → Depends on OpenAI API usage
  4. Can it detect fake certificates? → Yes, by comparing with university database
  5. What about old certificates? → Works if university has digitized records
