# ✅ Fixes Applied - Both Issues Resolved

## Issue 1: User Type Radio Buttons Not Visible ✅ FIXED

### Problem:
The Student/Admin radio buttons were not visible on the login page (http://localhost:5173)

### Solution Applied:
Updated `frontend/src/pages/Login.jsx`:
- Made radio buttons larger (18px x 18px)
- Added background container with border
- Added proper spacing and padding
- Added icons (👤 for Student, 🔐 for Admin)
- Increased visibility with better styling

### Result:
✅ Radio buttons now clearly visible  
✅ Easy to select Student or Admin  
✅ Visual feedback when selected

## Issue 2: University Portal Not Showing Admin Login ✅ FIXED

### Problem:
When accessing http://localhost:3000, it showed the API information page instead of the admin login page

### Solution Applied:
Updated `university-portal/backend/app.py`:
1. **Root route (/)** now redirects to `/admin.html`
2. **Added `/admin.html` route** to serve the admin login page
3. **Original info page** moved to `/info` route

### Result:
✅ http://localhost:3000 → Automatically redirects to admin login  
✅ http://localhost:3000/admin.html → Shows admin login page  
✅ http://localhost:3000/info → Shows API information (if needed)
