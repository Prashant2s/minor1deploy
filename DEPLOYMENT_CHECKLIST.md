# 🚀 Deployment Checklist for AI Certificate Verifier

## ✅ Pre-Deployment Testing (COMPLETED)

- [x] Backend imports successfully
- [x] Environment configuration loads correctly
- [x] Database connection working
- [x] API endpoints responding
- [x] File operations working
- [x] CORS headers configured
- [x] Frontend builds successfully
- [x] All dependencies installed

## 🔧 Backend Deployment Steps

### 1. Choose Deployment Platform

- [ ] **Railway** (Recommended - Easy setup)
- [ ] **Render** (Good alternative)
- [ ] **Heroku** (Traditional option)
- [ ] **DigitalOcean App Platform**

### 2. Backend Environment Variables

Set these in your deployment platform:

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=your_secure_password
CORS_ORIGIN=https://your-frontend-domain.netlify.app
MAX_FILE_SIZE=10485760
LOG_LEVEL=INFO
JWT_SECRET=your_secure_jwt_secret
```

### 3. Backend Deployment Commands

- **Railway**: Auto-deploy from GitHub
- **Render**:
  - Build: `cd backend && pip install -r requirements.txt`
  - Start: `cd backend && gunicorn app.main:app`
- **Heroku**: `git push heroku main`

## 🌐 Frontend Deployment Steps (Netlify)

### 1. Update Configuration

- [ ] Edit `netlify.toml` and replace `your-backend-url.railway.app` with your actual backend URL
- [ ] Set `VITE_API_URL` environment variable in Netlify dashboard

### 2. Netlify Environment Variables

```bash
VITE_API_URL=https://your-backend-url.railway.app/api/v1
```

### 3. Deploy

- [ ] Connect GitHub repository to Netlify
- [ ] Netlify will auto-build from `frontend/dist`
- [ ] Verify deployment URL

## 🧪 Post-Deployment Testing

### Backend Tests

- [ ] Health check: `https://your-backend-url.railway.app/api/v1/health`
- [ ] CORS working with frontend
- [ ] File upload endpoint accessible
- [ ] Database operations working

### Frontend Tests

- [ ] Frontend loads at Netlify URL
- [ ] Login/registration working
- [ ] File upload working
- [ ] API calls to backend successful
- [ ] Certificate processing working

### Integration Tests

- [ ] Upload a test certificate
- [ ] Verify AI processing works
- [ ] Check certificate display
- [ ] Test user authentication
- [ ] Verify file downloads

## 🔒 Security Checklist

- [ ] OpenAI API key is secure
- [ ] JWT secret is strong and unique
- [ ] CORS origin is specific (not wildcard)
- [ ] Database password is strong
- [ ] File upload size limits enforced
- [ ] HTTPS enabled on both frontend and backend

## 📊 Monitoring Setup

- [ ] Monitor OpenAI API usage and costs
- [ ] Set up error logging
- [ ] Monitor database performance
- [ ] Set up uptime monitoring
- [ ] Configure alerts for failures

## 🎯 Final Verification

- [ ] Application is fully functional
- [ ] All features working as expected
- [ ] Performance is acceptable
- [ ] Security measures in place
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Team notified of deployment

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **CORS Errors**: Check CORS_ORIGIN matches frontend URL exactly
2. **API Key Issues**: Verify OpenAI API key is valid and has credits
3. **Database Issues**: Check connection string and permissions
4. **File Upload Issues**: Verify upload directory permissions
5. **Build Failures**: Check all dependencies are installed

### Support Resources:

- Check deployment platform logs
- Verify environment variables
- Test health check endpoint
- Review application logs
- Check network connectivity
